name: triage-government-ai-use-case
description: Route an Australian government AI use case to the applicable assurance track — the mandatory DTA policy artefacts for Commonwealth entities or the state and territory frameworks for NSW, Victoria, Queensland, WA, SA, Tasmania, the ACT and the NT — with each jurisdiction's escalation threshold, using a verified registry and the national assurance framework. Use for government AI adoption, procurement and assurance planning. Do not use for private-sector obligations mapping, court generative-AI practice directions, privacy depth or a completed risk assessment.

# Triage Government AI Use Case

Route the use case to the right jurisdictional assurance track and name the
artefacts and escalation threshold that track requires. The triage output is
a routing, not a completed assessment.

Read the [source and control method](../../references/ai-governance-source-and-control-method.md)
and use the
[government AI assurance registry](references/government-ai-assurance-registry.json).

## Workflow

1. Fix the entity and use case.
   - Record the agency, jurisdiction, the AI system or use case, its purpose,
     affected people and deployment status. For a Commonwealth entity,
     confirm whether it is a non-corporate entity covered by the mandatory
     DTA policy.
2. Select the track from the registry.
   - Match the jurisdiction to its registry entry. Re-verify the named
     official source at use time: the registry is a research snapshot, and
     entries marked `lead-verify-before-use` or `verified-with-caveat` (SA
     and Tasmania at the snapshot date) must be confirmed against the
     official page or document before any assertion.
   - Note the national assurance framework as the cross-jurisdiction
     baseline, pegged to Australia's AI Ethics Principles.
3. Name the required artefacts and threshold.
   - Commonwealth: accountable official, AI transparency statement and AI
     impact assessment under DTA policy v2.0, with its phased commencement
     checked at the assessment date.
   - States and territories: the framework's self-assessment or risk
     assessment, and the escalation body or trigger recorded in the registry
     (for example NSW AI Review Committee; NT AI advisory service for medium
     and high-risk projects).
4. Flag adjacent obligations without assessing them.
   - Route privacy depth to `$assess-ai-privacy-cybersecurity-use-case` and
     jurisdictional privacy routing to
     `$route-australian-privacy-jurisdiction`. Verify any statutory
     proposition with the relevant `$check-*-legislation` skill.
   - Court or tribunal generative-AI practice directions are
     `OUTSIDE SCOPE` — identify the court and stop.
5. Set the human decision gate.
   - Name the accountable role in the agency, the artefacts to complete and
     the unresolved questions the assurance process must answer.

## Result contract

Lead with `READY FOR HUMAN REVIEW`, `READY WITH QUALIFICATIONS`, `NOT READY`
or `OUTSIDE SCOPE`.

```text
Entity and use case: <agency, jurisdiction, system, purpose, status>
Assurance track: <framework; official source; verification state at use time>
Required artefacts: <assessments, statements, accountable roles>
Escalation threshold: <body or trigger and when it engages>
National baseline: <national framework applicability note>
Adjacent routings: <privacy and legislation skills engaged or flagged>
Human decision gate: <accountable role and unresolved questions>
Limitations: <routing only; no completed risk assessment or approval>
```

## Fail closed

Return `NOT READY` when the jurisdiction, entity coverage or the current
official framework text cannot be established, and `OUTSIDE SCOPE` for
non-government entities and court practice directions. Never rely on a
registry entry marked `lead-verify-before-use` without confirming the
official source, never substitute the national framework for a mandatory
jurisdictional track, and never present the triage as a completed assurance
assessment.

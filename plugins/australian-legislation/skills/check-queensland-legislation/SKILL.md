# Check Queensland Legislation

Use `legislation.qld.gov.au` as the controlling source. Produce a provenance
record, not a bare assertion that legislation is "current".

Read [the shared point-in-time method](../../references/point-in-time-method.md)
before performing a check. It defines the official-source rules, identity
resolution, point-in-time selection and fail-closed boundary shared by every
State and Territory checker in this plugin.

## Workflow

1. Fix the scope.
   - Accept Queensland Acts and subordinate legislation.
   - Record the exact title, provision and requested date. If no date is
     given, use today's `Australia/Brisbane` date and state it explicitly.
   - Return `OUTSIDE SCOPE` for Bills, another jurisdiction, case treatment or
     a request for legal advice.
2. Resolve identity.
   - Search `legislation.qld.gov.au` and identify one official title and
     legislation type. Treat multiple plausible titles as ambiguous.
3. Select the point-in-time version.
   - Select the official in-force or historical reprint covering the requested
     date.
   - Record the reprint period, the title's present current or repealed status
     and the exact URL.
   - Keep the title's present status separate from whether the selected
     reprint operated on the requested date.
4. Check commencement and currency.
   - Inspect notes, commencement, amendment and reprint history relevant to
     the requested provision.
   - Do not infer operation from an as-made document or a URL date alone.
5. Report using the required result contract.

## Result contract

Lead with one status:

- `VERIFIED` — one official title and applicable version were identified with
  no unresolved qualification relevant to the request.
- `VERIFIED WITH QUALIFICATIONS` — identity and version were established, but
  an identified commencement, currency or authorisation limitation matters.
- `NOT VERIFIED` — official evidence is missing, inconsistent or insufficient.
- `OUTSIDE SCOPE` — the request is outside this Queensland metadata and text
  check.

Then provide:

```text
Requested check: <legislation and provision, if any>
Jurisdiction: Queensland, Australia
As at: <YYYY-MM-DD>
Official title: <title>
Type: <Act / subordinate legislation>
Current title status: <In force / Repealed / other official status>
Applicable version: <reprint identifier and effective date range>
Commencement evidence: <official commencement material inspected, or not established>
Currency flags: <none or itemised flags>
Official sources: <exact official pages actually inspected>
Checked: <date and Australian timezone>
Limitations and review: <what remains unverified and the human-review point>
```

Cite the exact official page supporting each field. Never describe the result
as legal advice or as proof of interpretation, application or legal effect.

## Fail closed

Return `NOT VERIFIED` instead of guessing when the title or type is ambiguous,
the requested date cannot be tied to a displayed reprint, the official
publisher is unavailable, or a relevant commencement, amendment or currency
issue cannot be resolved. Case law is outside scope.

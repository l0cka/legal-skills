# AI use-case assessment method

## Intake schema

Establish these facts before recommending deployment:

| Domain | Required facts |
| --- | --- |
| Purpose and benefit | Specific problem, intended benefit, evidence of need, lower-risk alternatives and measures of success |
| People and decision | Users, affected people, vulnerability, decision or action, consequence of error, human authority and contestability |
| System | Product, provider, model and version, hosting, integrations, tools or actions, update process and system boundaries |
| Data | Sources, categories, provenance, authority, identifiability, quality, prompts, retrieval, training use, outputs, logs, location, access, retention and deletion |
| Vendor and supply chain | Terms, privacy and security documentation, subprocessors, offshore handling, model improvement, incident notice, audit, change, suspension and exit rights |
| Controls and evidence | Testing, access controls, filtering, review, logging, monitoring, incident response, rollback, evaluation results and accountable owners |

An assertion that the provider is certified, compliant, enterprise-grade or
does not train on data is a claim to verify, not a control by itself.

## Suitability outcomes

- `SUITABLE`: verified law and evidence reveal no material unresolved privacy
  or cyber blocker for the bounded use, and required controls are operating and
  tested. Ordinary approval and monitoring still apply.
- `SUITABLE WITH CONTROLS`: the use can proceed only after specified,
  testable controls are implemented and approved. Do not use this outcome if a
  decisive legal threshold or high-consequence failure remains unknown.
- `PILOT ONLY`: value or safety is plausible but evidence is insufficient for
  production. Limit people, data, functionality, duration and integrations;
  prohibit consequential decisions and uncontrolled external actions.
- `NOT SUITABLE ON CURRENT INFORMATION`: a material conflict, uncontrolled
  high-consequence risk, disproportionate data use, unavailable essential
  control or inability to meet a legal requirement prevents the proposed use.
- `INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION`: missing facts prevent a defensible outcome.
  State the shortest evidence-gathering path to a decision.

These are advisory workflow outcomes, not legal conclusions or system
certification.

## Hard-stop and pilot-only prompts

Consider `NOT SUITABLE ON CURRENT INFORMATION` or `INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION`
when any of the following is material and unresolved:

- the purpose, accountable owner, affected people, system boundary or data flow
  cannot be defined;
- authority to use the data or make the proposed disclosure is not established;
- privileged, sensitive, health, secret or security-relevant material would be
  sent to an unapproved or uncontrolled system;
- a consequential action lacks meaningful human authority, validation,
  contestability, logging or rollback;
- provider terms, training use, subprocessors, hosting, retention, deletion,
  incident notice or exit cannot be established;
- prompt injection, insecure tools or excessive permissions could cause
  external action or material data access without effective containment; or
- a required legal proposition, security test or control is not verified.

Use `PILOT ONLY` when those risks can be safely isolated with non-production or
synthetic data, no consequential decisions, no uncontrolled tools, limited
users, short duration, monitoring and clear stop conditions.

## Candidate law and source routing

Use the official point-in-time legislation text. Invoke
`$check-commonwealth-legislation` for Commonwealth titles and
`$check-nsw-legislation` for NSW titles. Invoke
`$trace-commonwealth-legislative-change` when the proposed deployment or review
period crosses a Commonwealth amendment or commencement date.
Invoke `$check-australian-privacy-principles` whenever personal information or
APP-entity coverage is possible. Its decision horizon should cover the known
pilot, deployment, retention and next-review periods. A detected or unverified
APP-framework change blocks a positive suitability or pilot recommendation
until the affected analysis is refreshed.

Candidate material may include:

- *Privacy Act 1988* (Cth), the Australian Privacy Principles, data-breach
  provisions and current or commencing automated-decision transparency
  provisions;
- applicable State or Territory public-sector privacy, health-records,
  surveillance and workplace-surveillance legislation;
- *Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018* (Cth), *Cyber Security Act
  2024* (Cth), Consumer Data Right, My Health Record, telecommunications and
  sector-specific legislation or instruments when triggered; and
- regulator guidance and AI risk-management standards, separately labelled as
  non-legislative material.

Verify commencement and application dates. An enacted future amendment is not
current law merely because its text exists. Preserve legislation-skill currency
flags and known-future-change qualifications.

After live APP verification, test each principle in the verified inventory
against the use case. Pay particular attention to governance and transparency,
collection and notice, secondary model-training or evaluation uses, overseas
providers, data quality, security and deletion, access and correction. These
are issue prompts rather than a fixed statement of the APP framework.

Case law is outside scope. Separately refer material discrimination, consumer,
employment, intellectual-property, administrative, recordkeeping,
professional-duty and other sector-law issues; do not imply that a privacy and
cyber assessment completes those workstreams.

## Risk-control evidence

For each risk, distinguish:

1. inherent risk event and plausible harm;
2. preventive, detective, responsive and recovery controls;
3. design documents or vendor claims;
4. operating evidence from relevant testing;
5. residual uncertainty and acceptance owner.

Prefer use-case-specific evaluation over generic benchmark scores. Include
representative normal, edge, adversarial and affected-person scenarios. Define
acceptance criteria before testing, preserve results and set review triggers
for model, provider, data, integration, purpose or legal change.

The data-flow, document-comparison and explicit-criteria patterns are informed
by the MIT-licensed Harvey AI `harvey-labs` data-privacy-cybersecurity task
corpus. No foreign-law conclusion, fictional scenario, client artefact or
rubric answer is included.
